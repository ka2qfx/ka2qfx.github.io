<center>The G5RV Mystique
<br>By KA2QFX</center>

<p>It amazes me how the misconception of the G5RV being an all-band antenna
continues to prevail. For years the G5RV has been described, sold to, and
used by many hams as an all band antenna. It is not, and never was, designed
as a multi band antenna. However, given a good external antenna tuner and
low-loss* feedline any piece of wire is tunable to function on all bands.
<p>Even Mr. Varney (G5RV) never intended this misconception to prevail
yet it persists to this day despite the efforts of many knowledgeable persons
to dispel the myth through the publications of ARRL, Ham Radio, etc. I
believe it borders on criminal for vendors to sell this antenna knowing
that the purchaser has been led to believe that this antenna has some magical
properties permitting all band use to the extent that it is resonant and
requires little matching on other bands. With that in mind let's discuss
what the G5RV really IS!

<p>The above chart shows the characteristics of the antenna elements on
a G5RV style antenna. To describe what these numbers mean and why they
matter I will describe the design criteria of the G5RV to put them into
perspective.
<p>Any wire antenna is generally based upon the concept of 1/4-wave elements.
Remembering the graph of a sinusoid from high school, assume that graph
represents the voltage along the wire. Label the center of the graph 0,
with + and - 180 on the left and right ends. Since the end of the wire
in our antenna is open to free space, there can be nowhere for current
to flow. Hence, that end point must be a high voltage node. A high voltage
node will occur at +/- 90 degrees from the center of the graph. Working
our way back towards the center 90 degrees we find ourselves at 0, where
the voltage is a minimum and coincidentally current is a maximum. Extending
from -90 on the left to +90 degrees on the right yields the 180 degrees
of a half wave dipole. It's that simple to understand. But these high voltage
nodes also occur at 270 degrees from the feedpoint, and so on, at every
odd multiple of 1/4 waves from the feedpoint. So we could have an antenna
using elements of 1/4, 3/4, 5/4, 7/4 etcetera. Increasing the length tends
to increase gain and impedance while reducing bandwidth slightly, but by
and large the feedpoint is always a low voltage (current) node, primarily
resistive, with little or no reactive component, and can easily be matched
to most transmitters with little difficulty. Draw the graph of the sinusoid
to help conceptualize this. (If you superimpose on the graph a Cosine wave
you'll have the current graph as well.)
<p>Using this premise, Mr. Varney (G5RV) devised an antenna that is 3/4
wavelengths per leg on 20 meters. This yields a resistive impedance of
approximately 100+ ohms, easily matched to most transmitters, and yielding
very acceptable performance on 20 meters.
<p>"What about the matching section", you ask? Well, it isn't really a
matching section at all. The purpose of the open wire feeder is to provide
a connection to the antenna at convenient distance from the antenna. It
could be any length if used all the way to the tuner, but to accommodate
a connection to Coax Mr. Varney made it exactly (180 degrees) 1/2 wave
long on 20 meters to specifically NOT transform the impedance of the antenna.
Using any thing other than 1/2 wave sections of line would have changed
the impedance, but that's another concept that I'll demonstrate further
on. Going back to our sinusoid, you'll see that the magnitude of the phase
angle is the same for any two points along the wave that are 180 degrees
apart! This 1/2 wave section simple brings the antennas feedpoint impedance,
unchanged, to a new location 1/2 wave away for attachment to a coaxial
feedline, the length of coax is irrelevant since it is connecting to an
impedance that is ideally resistive. That's what the G5RV is, no more no
less. It is a 20 meter antenna, period! But it can, and is, used on other
bands! How can this be? Well, for any other band, as shown in the table
above, it acts as a random length dipole which can be tuned for all but
the worst conditions with a good tuner. *However, if fed with coax, the
losses will be significant for the higher SWR conditions that exist when
the antenna's impedance differs greatly from 50 ohms. Using open wire line
all the way to the tuner would largely alleviate this loss.
<p>As you can see from the table for the full size G5RV, this antenna is
probably tunable for most of the bands except 10. On 10 meters the feedpoint
is almost 90 degrees out of phase, resulting in an extremely high impedance
(close to a voltage node) that is very difficult to tune. However, this
can be remedied by applying an inverse of Mr. Varney's "non-matching" section
with a true matching section of open wire line that is an odd multiple
of 1/4 wave lengths. This 90-degree phasing section will transform the
voltage node at the feedpoint to a current node on the fed end, thereby
yielding a tunable load impedance. Voila! But now this comprises a "band
specific" antenna system doesn't it? Well, it was before too, and that's
the point.
<p>While I haven't work out all the complex impedances for different lengths
of matching section, I suspect this antenna, using a 10-meter matching
section, will still tune several bands with a good tuner. Although, once
again, feeding any antenna with a high SWR through coaxial cable will be
fairly lossy. Should you choose to use coax to connect to an open wire
section on this antenna, or any antenna, a balun MUST be used to minimize
feedline radiation from currents that WILL seek to flow on the braid. The
open wire feeder is balanced, the coax is unbalanced, nothing will change
those facts and a balance to unbalanced transformer (balun) should be used!
Unless you don't care about RF on your feedline, in your shack, etc it's
better to have a balun. Ignore those comments about balun losses; baluns
don't dissipate any significant power unless you've got bigger problems
with your antenna system's balance. But that's another story altogether.
<p>Lastly, what about this 1/2 sized G5RV. Well, it's hardly a G5RV but
let's not quibble, it's descriptively accurate. It is however a scaled
down version of the same design and as such will resonant at 1/2 the wavelength.
Looking at the table shows this fact on 10 meters where it exhibits a resistive
load for 3/4 wave leg lengths on that band and similarly reactive loads
for other bands
<p>About the table:
<br>The first column shows the physical length of the overall antenna in
wavelengths for the different bands. I didn't include 75 meters since it's
performance is so poor as to be pathetic, but it will operate on that band,
just don't expect any great signal reports. The second column shows the
wavelength of each leg (1/2 element) as seen at the feedpoint. The third
column shows the feedpoint characteristic as being a resistive (node) or
a reactive load. Following the characteristic is the phase error of these
reactive components. A " -" indicates a "capacitive" type reactance and
"+" indicates an "inductive" reactance. Each load has a different complex
impedance comprised of a resistive and reactive (j) component, eg: approx.
103 + j48.6 occurs on 20 meters for a full size G5RV. Since the j component
is relatively small matching is less difficult for a simple tuner. Some
value of resistance would exist for the other more reactive conditions
as well, like 298 - j1000 for 15 meters. In this case there's a lot more
reactance to be tuned out and most internal units can't deal with it. And
if fed with coax, the mismatch will contribute to much more feedline loss.
The last column shows the total length in degrees for each leg. Subtracting
from this the nearest divisible odd multiple of 90 yields the phase error
in the previous column.
<p>Check out this site, <a href="http://www.qsl.net/k2hq/g5rv.htm">www.qsl.net/k2hq/g5rv.htm</a>.
 His numbers are more worked out than mine since he used a computer based antenna-modeling
program. If you look at this site you'll see that the SWR and impedances
presented can get quite out of hand, over 3,000 ohms for 10 meters, as
I suggested.
<p>I hope this helps make some sense of the G5RV, as well as other antennas.
Understanding the basic concepts of antennas will make you a wiser consumer.
Remember, there is no magic in any antenna design; it's all based on the
same basic physics which have been known for many years. Do not be duped
into believing the claims of some of these ads. Smaller antennas generally
yield smaller signals, narrow bandwidth doesn't mean bad, low SWR doesn't
mean it's getting your signal out, etc. Read some of the ARRL publications,
The Handbook is a good start, if you like you can delve deeper with the
Antenna Handbook. There are lots of good references out there. It's interesting
and a lot of fun to build effective antennas and tuners with junk parts.
You'll be amazed what you can accomplish with $15 worth of wire and a good
balun.
