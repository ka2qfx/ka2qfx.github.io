Half Sourdough Bread (c)1992 M.W. Sedutto<br>

	Half Sourdough, what the heck is that? Well, if you like the richer taste of sourdough breads but don't like the really strong type that sometimes simply taste rancid... or if you don't like handling the slow rising, sticky sourdough dough then this is a recipe you'll appreciate.<br> 
	In simple terms, this is a simple French or Italian bread recipe, which is flavored with a little whole-wheat flour, and some well cultured sourdough biga.  This bread also keeps extremely well.<br><br> 

3 1/2 cups Flour (Bread flour preferred)<br>
1/2 cup Whole-Wheat Flour<br>
2 tsp salt<br>
1 tbsp Corn Syrup<br>
2 tbsp vegetable oil<br>
1 1/4 cups water<br>
1 cup Biga <br>
Baking Stone<br>
Corn meal<br>
Egg White<br><br>

Dissolve and proof yeast well in water and corn syrup.<br><br> 

Mix salt and flours well in large mixing bowl<br><br>

Whisk Biga and salad oil together well and add to flour.<br>
Turn flour until all liquid is absorbed. Turn onto board and knead well until smooth.<br>
Return to bowl, cover and let rise until doubled. <br> 
Punch down, return to board and form into large round or long loaf or two baguettes.<br><br>

Place on peel sprinkled liberally with corn meal or place on parchment.<br>
Let rise 10 to 30 minutes depending on desired density. I usually don't go more than a 50% increase in size. <br><br>  

Just before placing in oven brush with water and sprinkle on seeds if desired. Slash diagonally several times with sharp knife or razor. <br>

Slide onto baking stone in 425ºF oven for 30-35 minutes.<br>
Brush with egg wash (4 parts water-1 part egg white) 5 minutes before removing from oven. <br><br>

For different texture try omitting or varying the amount and type of oil in this recipe.<br>
