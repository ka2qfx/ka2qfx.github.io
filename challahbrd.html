Challah Bread/Sweet Rolls/Cinnamon Buns




This is very much like a Brioche dough, only using less egg and subbing oil for butter. It is sweet and tender.
It makes really good bread for French Toast.<br>

&nbsp	5 cups of flour<br>
&nbsp	2 1/2 - 2 3/4 cups water (depending on egg size, total volume of water plus eggs will end up (2 cups)<br>
&nbsp	2-3 eggs (again, depending on size)
&nbsp	1/3 cup vegetable oil
&nbsp	1/2 cup sugar.<br>
&nbsp	2 packages yeast.<br>
&nbsp	1-2 teaspoons salt (depending on taste. I've been using about 1 1/2tsp.)<br>
&nbsp	Egg white for glazing.<br><br>

	Work oil into flour well as per other recipes.<br>
	Combine lukewarm water with yeast, 1 tbsp. of the sugar and let proof.<br>
	After proofing add remaining sugar, salt and eggs. Blend well.<br>
	Add liguid to flour mixture and until combined. Place dough on work surface and knead until smooth.<br>
	Return to bowl, cover and let rise until doubled.<br> 
	Punchdown risen dough and return to work surface. Divide dough into as many pieces as you wish to braid. Classic Challah is four or more pieces but I use three. <br>
	Roll divided portions into long pieces with the ends tapering almost to a point. Important: During this try to get out all the larger gas bubbles.<br>
	Form braided loaf and leave on baking surface to rise about 50 -70%. If you can place the loaf on parchment it would be preferrable but corm meal will do to prevent sticking.<br><br>


	Bake 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes. During the last 5 minutes, brush on a liberal coating of egg wash 
(50 % water, 50% egg white) and place back in the oven. This may be required a second time just before you 
remove it from the oven for a nice glaze.<br><br>

For rolls:<br>
	This recipe also make great rolls using 2" inch balls place 1/2" apart and risen until they touch. 
Bake 20-25 minutes at 350. <br><br>

For Cinnamon buns: <br>
	After first rise, roll out dough to about the size of a 1/2 sheet pan. About 14" x 20"<br>
	Spread over dough, leaving a 1/2 inch border around edges, 1 stick of softened butter.<br>
	Cover butter with mixture of 1 cup light brown sugar, 1-2 tbsp cinnamon, and 1/2 cup pecan pieces.<br>
	Roll up dough the long way and press edges close. <br> 
	Slice the roll carefully with sharp knife into 1" pieces.<br>
	Place slices in a WELL buttered baking pan just touching each other. Cover and let rise until about doubled.<br>
	Bake 25 minutes at 350 degrees.<br>
	
Cream Cream Cheese icing for buns:<br>
&nbsp	8 oz. cream cheese<br>
&nbsp	3- 4 cups confectioner's sugar.<br>
&nbsp	1/2 tsp. vanilla (Optional)<br>
&nbsp	Milk as needed for consitency. About 1/4 cup +/-.<br><br>

	Soften cream cheese to room temperature, work in sugar a little at a time with a rubber spatula or spoon. 
Add milk, vannila and sugar as needed until all are combined and icing has a smooth, spreadable consitency. 
If you have a heavy whisk and a strong arm it may be useful. Spread over cinnamon buns when cool. Icing keeps 
well in fridge for later use. <br><br>
