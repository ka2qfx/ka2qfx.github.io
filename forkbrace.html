<P ALIGN="center">Here's some rough sketches of the fork brace I made for the bike. The performance difference was very dramatic<br>
Before installing the brace changing lanes over 60mph was a thrilling experience and laying over in turns was downright scary. <br>
Since adding the brace I have complete confidence in the bike at any highway speed and turns are only limited by road surface and <br>
scraping the pegs. </p>
