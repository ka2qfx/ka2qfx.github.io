	An antenna of this size for 75 and 40 meters has a very low radiation resistance, typically 8-15 ohms. My 75 meter radiation resistance appears
 to be about 10 ohms. The lossier versions of such mobile antennas have higher impedances largely due to resistive losses. Trading high performance
 and narrower bandwidth for lower losses seemed acceptable to me, but it requires some way to match the impedance to the coax, particularly when
 operating slightly off resonance with a tuner. I went with the unbalanced to unbalanced transmission line transformer to accomplish this impedance
 matching. Here's why:<br><br>

 The great advantage of transmission line transformer matching over other methods, such as tapped coils and tuned shunts, is that it's not very
 sensitive to frequency. Or in other words, the matching device does not effect the resonant frequency of the antenna. These devices can be
 incredibly efficient when built with the right materials. Loss measurements are typically less than 0.1dB. My crude tests in the shack show
 better than 98% efficiency, somewhat better then 0.08dB loss! Sure beats the loss on the coax with a 4:1 impedance mismatch.<br><br>
 Once your antenna is tuned to resonance you could remove the xfmr and still operate with reasonable effectivness since the tuning won't channge.
 Yes, your SWR will rise but your resonant antenna currents will still be where you need them to radiate effectivley.  If using an antenna tuner
 without the transformer, you can certainly tune the "system" for a match, but the losses after the tuner remain the same since the cable and load
 are still mismatched.  Similarly, you can retune, or change bands (40 meters in my case) and not have to play with the matching network at all
 since the transformer is basically frequency independant throughout the HF band. Different types of cores can be selected to optimize the passband
 for different frequency ranges. Some are best from several hundred KHz through 10 MHz, while others will be most effective from a few MHz to over
 50MHz or more. My xfmr falls in the latter category as I assumed 160 Meters to be a low priority, and likely an even lower radiation resistance 
will require a differnt xfmr for that band anyway. <br><br>
Bottom line is; I think transmission line transformers are remarkably effective and useful devices. While somehwat abstract to understand they are 
very easy to build. For more detailed information and lots of cookbook style examples Jerry Sevick's book on tranmission line tranformers

Input impedance on this antenna on 40 meters is about 17 ohms, so the transformer still does a good job matching down from 50.<br><br>

To be fair, I did play around with some conventional methods of shunt coil and series capacitor matching, but it changed the resonance of the
 whole antenna and I couldn't change bands without having several prefab matching networks to swap. Way too much work, certainly nothing I could
 jump out and do at a red light. <br><br>

75m bandwidth is 9 KHz and 40m bandwidth is 16 KHz on this antenna. If you don't have a tuner in your radio you can operate reasonably well over
 this bandwidth without it. After that you have to move or add coil taps (hence the convenience of my bandswitch).<br><br>

Construction:<br>
 
The mount uses a standard insulated SO-239 to 3/8'-24tpi whip coupling through the bracket. $4.99 at Radio Shack. This allowed me to fabricate a
 sealed enclosure using 2-1/2" PVC pipe with panel mount SO-239s on each end in polycarbonate and caps. End caps are sealed with O-rings and held by three 4-40 screws.
Finally, a 26 gauge copper strap from end to end provides a solid ground for input and output and is stamped with each terminal's impedance.
The 2 1/4" overall diameter of the transformer is fits perfect in this pipe. <br><br>

Basically, this is a simple unbalanced-unbalanced 4:1 Ruthroff transformer. It uses two toroidal cores (although one would have been
 sufficient) of medim permeability type 43 ferrite (mu = 850). Around this is wound 9 turns of DOUBLED 50 ohm tranmission line. Ideally, this line's 
impedance should be the arithmetic mean between to the two terminating impedances. In this case, matching 50:12.5 ohms would require 25 ohm coax or 
stripline. Well, I didn't have either, and I didn't want make 25 ohm stripline, for reasons I won't go into. But I did have some of that nice 50 ohm, 
teflon insulated RG-174U. It's about 0.1" diameter and using two in parallel yeilds 25 ohms. I don't know why but the idea of using parallel windings 
for this purpose isn't suggested in the references I've reviewed. So I take credit for assuming the obvious. I later discovered others have done this 
successfully. It works great!<br><br>
