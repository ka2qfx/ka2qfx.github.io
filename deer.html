This litle guy dressed out about 150 lbs. That's not bad for southern New York
State.<br>
He's a swamp buck given the dark rack. Probably about three years old. Not the
biggest deer,<br>
on the mountain but a nearly perfect rack. We named him &quot;Stupid&quot;
since the first shot through brush<br>
deflected, whereupon he ran right towards me. I had to yell at him to get him
to stop and turn to get<br>
a broadside shot at him.<br>
