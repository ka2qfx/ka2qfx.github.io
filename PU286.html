This is my backup generator for the house and station.  There's VERY little info available for this machine since water cooled stuff was phased out of the military
right after this was deployed, so no service literature was ever distributed.  I've had to reverse engineer it quite a bit to get it running. The entire control
wiring harness had been cut out. I assume that was done to "demil" it.<br><br>
  Anyway, here are some pix and the schematics as best as I've been able to determine. It runs well enough
but I'm currently designing a solid state feild regulator for the AC alternator, since that was also missing. I'll publish that when completed, it's been a little
tricky bit of servo design to get a really smooth working regulator. I'll do a full write up when done.<br><br>
