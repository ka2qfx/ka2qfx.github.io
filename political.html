Obligatory political statement:

<br><br>

Although guns are offensively portrayed as linked to violence and death by the media, here 
is a different view of guns (and their history) that is far less offensive than 
Andres Seranno's 'Piss Christ' or Maplethorpes "art" (and that was funded by the NEA 
with your tax dollars).<BR><BR>Here is a testament to the real artistry and creativity that some would term
evil.  The media would have us ignore the fact that such 
inclination toward "gun rights" is responsible for the freedoms that we now have. From the 
Revolutionary war to the Gulf we've been fighting (and dieing) to preserve these inalienable rights we feel are so important that we sacrifice our youth to preserve them.<BR><BR> 
Let us not forget these rights are also imbued with responsibility, our freedom depends upon 
stewardship and can be diminished readily should we take it for granted. Remember, the Bill of Rights does NOT grant us rights, it merely enumerates that which is inalienable. 'Nuff said. <br><br>
